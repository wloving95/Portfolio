        <p>Weston Loving received his B.S. in Journalism from Brooklyn College in 2021.  It was during his time at Brooklyn College that he had a live radio show and podcast for the WBCR, Brooklyn Collegeâ€™s radio station. Weston also served on the board for WBCR during his senior year. During his senior year he interned for Townsquare Media and had his writing published for the first time.</p>
        <p>Journalism did not call him at first. He started his college career pursuing a degree in Finance. Realizing his mistake he then switched majors to political science. Finally, he switched majors again to Journalism and found his true calling.</p>
        <p> After hearing the praises of the Craig Newmark School of Journalism at CUNY from his undergraduate professors and investigated the school. Weston quickly found ideals and standards which aligned with his own. His interest in better serving under reported on communities as well as a desire to reflect upon the industry of journalism led him to the Engagement Journalism program offering of the Newmark School. It is here that he hopes to continue his education in journalism and fight for better industry standards for the field of journalism.</p>
